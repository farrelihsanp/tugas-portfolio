          As a Senior Full Stack Web Developer with over five years of
          experience, I have honed my skills in both front-end and back-end
          development, allowing me to create robust and scalable web
          applications. My journey began with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript, which I complemented with frameworks like React and
